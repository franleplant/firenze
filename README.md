# Firenze

**A web3 native communication tool.**

Fireneze is a fully decentralized uncensurable free web3 native messaging app.
Login with your wallet and talk to other wallets or ens domains.
To be able to send messages to another wallet, that wallet needs to have an active ceramic DID,
or they have to log in into Firenze at least once.

> **important** Firenze is just a prototype in alpha stage, use it carefully.


If you like Firenze please let us know through an issue.
